## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Tips
- **Camera not detected or not working?**
  - Ensure your webcam is connected and not in use by another app.
  - Try running as administrator or check your system's privacy/camera settings.
  - Update your camera drivers if you see low-level errors in the logs.
  - If you see OpenCV/driver errors, these are now suppressed to only show critical issues.
- **Missing background image?**
  - If the custom background image is missing, the app will use a black background and print a warning.
- **Favicon and UI screenshot:**
  - The web UI includes a favicon and a screenshot for a polished, professional look.
- **Logging and error handling:**
  - The backend suppresses verbose OpenCV logs and provides clear error messages for device and streaming issues.
